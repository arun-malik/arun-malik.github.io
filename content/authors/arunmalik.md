# Hey, I'm Arun! 👋

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Microsoft**, where I spend my days building cool stuff for **Azure Networking** and **Security**. When I'm not busy making the cloud more secure, you’ll find me nerding out about tech, coding, and maybe even tinkering with the occasional *rubber duck* 🦆.

### 🚀 What I Do:
- **Network Security**: Making sure the cloud is safe, one line of code at a time.
- **Baremetal & Vulnerability Tracking**: I track and squish vulnerabilities like a digital exterminator. 🐞
- **Mentorship**: Helping junior engineers be the best they can be (and occasionally showing them where the *real* coffee is). ☕

### 📚 I Write About:
- Cloud security
- Tech leadership
- Software engineering tips and tricks
- And maybe a *bit* about how to survive in a hybrid work environment 😅


I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts as much as I enjoy writing them! Let’s connect and chat about tech. 🤖

Thanks for reading, and remember:  
**Keep coding and stay curious!**  
If your code doesn’t work, just call it “experimental” and keep moving forward. 😉
