## Zero Trust in Azure: Because Trust is Overrated

In today’s digital world, securing your cloud environment is crucial, and a **Zero Trust** approach is one of the best ways to protect against unauthorized access and potential breaches. When implementing Zero Trust in **Azure**, there are several strategies that can help secure your network and ensure that every request, connection, and user is continuously verified. Here’s a breakdown of key strategies to secure your Azure environment using **Zero Trust** principles.

## Key Strategies for Zero Trust in Azure

### 1. External Scanning (e.g., Nmap) to Test Exposed Endpoints

A **Zero Trust** strategy begins with minimizing the attack surface. Use external scanning tools like **Nmap** to periodically scan your environment for exposed endpoints. These scans help identify any services or applications that might be unintentionally exposed to the public internet, allowing you to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

- **Tip:** Regular external vulnerability scanning should be automated, ensuring continuous monitoring for any accidental exposure.

### 2. Promote Private Links & Service Endpoints

One of the core tenets of Zero Trust is to limit communication to trusted, private networks. Azure **Private Links** and **Service Endpoints** allow your services to connect securely within your virtual network, bypassing public internet exposure entirely.

- **Action:** Use **Azure Private Link** for services like **Azure Storage** and **SQL Database** to ensure all data traffic is routed securely over private endpoints, preventing any potential data leaks.

### 3. Secure Access with Network Security Groups (NSG) and Service Tags

Network security groups (NSGs) are essential in enforcing access control in your Azure environment. Zero Trust mandates that access should be as restrictive as possible. **Service Tags** in NSGs allow you to define rules that apply to specific Azure services and regions, ensuring you can only communicate with the services and environments you trust.

- **Strategy:** Limit access to specific environments by using NSGs with **Service Tags** (e.g., `VirtualNetwork`, `AzureLoadBalancer`) to restrict which traffic is allowed based on services or IP ranges.

### 4. Use Azure Policies for Default Policy Enforcement

Azure Policies provide a powerful way to enforce organization-wide security standards. Create policies that automatically detect changes to network configurations and apply default denial rules in NSGs with high priority.

- **Action:** Use **Azure Policies** to enforce rules like:
  - **Network Change Detection:** Ensure network changes are reviewed and approved before being implemented.
  - **Default Denial in NSGs:** Create policies that automatically apply **deny** rules to NSGs at a high priority, ensuring unauthorized traffic is always blocked by default.
  - **NSG Creation in Subnets:** Automatically attach an NSG to subnets that don’t have one, ensuring all network traffic is monitored and controlled.

### 5. Leverage Azure Virtual Network Manager (AVNM)

To implement a **Zero Trust** network across your Azure environment, use **Azure Virtual Network Manager (AVNM)** at the management group level. AVNM allows you to centralize and enforce network policies for your Azure Virtual Networks, ensuring consistent traffic rules across all subscriptions and resource groups.

- **Action:** Create **default denial policies** that restrict traffic to trusted endpoints, preventing teams from inadvertently bypassing security measures by overriding traffic rules.

### 6. Regular Attestation & Ownership Reviews

As part of maintaining a **Zero Trust** model, it’s essential to regularly attestate and verify ownership of resources. This encourages accountability and ensures that your teams are aware of their responsibility for the services and infrastructure they manage.

- **Strategy:** Conduct regular attestation reviews where teams provide ownership and usage information for the resources they manage. This process helps ensure that teams are continuously adhering to security best practices and policies.

### 7. **Shift Left: Security Early in the Development Cycle**
   Security should not be an afterthought but part of the development process from the very beginning. Implement a **Shift Left** approach by integrating security practices early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This can include practices such as code scanning, vulnerability assessments, and automated security testing, all before the code reaches production. By identifying potential threats earlier, you reduce the risk of security issues later. Learn more about [Shift Left in DevSecOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/security/shift-left).

## Conclusion

Securing your Azure environment with Zero Trust principles requires a combination of automation, vigilant monitoring, and strict access control. By using strategies such as external scanning, promoting private endpoints, leveraging NSGs, enforcing policies, and implementing AVNM, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your critical assets. Don’t forget the importance of ongoing attestation, as it helps ensure continuous adherence to security standards and fosters a culture of accountability across your teams.

By adopting these strategies, your Azure environment will not only be more secure but also more resilient to potential threats. Zero Trust is a journey, and the earlier you start, the stronger your defenses will be.
